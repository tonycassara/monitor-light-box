## Use your monitor as a light source for videography and photography

**Note:** Works best if you have Night Shift disabled.

Take advantage of your existing light sources including computer monitors, TVs, and handheld devices. This dead simple web app makes it easy to add another light source from any of your internet connected devices. Just visit https://tonycassara.github.io/monitor-light-box and start shining!
